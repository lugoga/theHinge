# Masumbuko Semba
is a data scientist and spatial analyst at the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology. With experience in programming, he has always found ways to meld his passion for writing with his joy of logical problem solving and data science. From the boardroom to the classroom, Semba enjoys finding dynamic ways to parterner with inderdisciplinary and diverse teams to make complex ideas and projects understandble and solvable. Outside academia, he spends his time working on data from various sources. 

Though is familiar with MATLAB and Python, but I am a big fun of R programming language. I enjoy creating code to streamline my analytical framework . Coding is nothing more than telling a computer what to do in a language the computer understands. I love coding because code helps develop critical thinking skills and ability to glean right answers to problems facing the society. He enjoy the modern syntax in R brought by tidyverse and magritr that made easier doing data science in R. He developed this blog with a prime aim to  share some ground-breaking analytical solutions using R programming language, a free but powerful for working data, visualize results and make report in multiple formats (Words, HTML, Epub, and PDF).
