### Packages

1. a **wior** packaged built by **Masumbuko Semba** and **Nyamisi Peter** focusing on Easy Tidy and Process Oceanographic Data. The packages is basically developed to help marine and freshwater scientist access a large and varied format of in-situ and satellite data in easy way. In fact the package has made data access in much easy way. The authors are trying to remove the barrier of data access and leave a space for scientists to focus in much deeper thinking of their field rather than spending several days to understand codes for a specific data download. The package contains several tools that allows scientist to get a wide array of datasets. And the funny things is that you get a tidy format result of the download, which is easy to handle in R and also to share it out of R environment. The tidy format is in form that many scientist familiar with Excel spreadsheet will find it handy. You can access this package through this link: https://github.com/lugoga/wior
