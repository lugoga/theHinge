<p>It’s important to ensure that the mode of data collection is well described—-what data will be produced in a project, and how it will be managed during the project, and how it will become/remain accessible to the scientific community after the project. The normal method for compliance with these policies is to write a Data Management Plan. The key points for inclusion are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>What types of data will be created?</li>
<li>How will these data be processed?</li>
<li>How will they be stored and backed up?</li>
<li>How will they be documented (inc. naming conventions, directory structures etc)?</li>
<li>How will these data be of benefit to the broader scientific community?</li>
<li>How will they be archived and will they comply with any data/metadata standards?</li>
<li>How will they be made available and discoverable to the broader community?</li>
<li>What are the policies for sharing, re-use etc?</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary aim is to ensure that the data is collected in good manner and stored in a matter that ensure reproducible work with other activities and the work will be of benefit to the whole community.</p>
